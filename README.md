## How it works?

The usage is as follows.

- A + B Returns the winner.
- A - B Returns the loser.

```
show Spock - (Lizard + Paper)
```
Returns
```
Lizard eats Paper (winner Lizard)
Lizard poisons Spock (loser Spock)
Result = Spock
```


# Overview
## Domain-Specific Language pattern

>Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, 
lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, 
lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, 
and as it always has, rock crushes scissors." 

\-  *Sheldon Cooper (The Big Bang Theory.)*

We are opening our first *Cooper Spock Parser* created by Daniel Sada & Jose Manuel Castilla, This is our parser for solving multiple chains of a  complex Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. It can solve complex Rock Paper  Scissors Lizard Spock chains. 

According to Wikipedia 
>A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains.

The usage is as follows.

- A + B Returns the winner.
- A - B Returns the loser.

```
show Spock - (Lizard + Paper)
```
Returns
```
Lizard eats Paper (winner Lizard)
Lizard poisons Spock (loser Spock)
Result = Spock
```

To test the program, inside the main folder type the following 
instruction at the command line:

    ruby -I -w jakenpon_test.rb
